# Interview Questions


<br />
## General

- data team: DSA and data science questions; algorithms and data structures questions with attention to complexity and possible optimizations.
- design question for some hypothetical Task object. write the algorithm and design all the classes required to complete all the tasks, subtasks, and their dependent tasks.
- describe a particularly difficult concurrency problem you have faced and you solved it?
- general big-O questions, hashmap vs binary tree, heap data structure.
- given a log of pages clicked on zillow's website by users (sorted by timestamp), find the top ten most clicked 3 page sequence. A 3 page sequence, is a sequence of 3 pages clicked by the same user in successive order.
- how does garbage collection work in .NET?
- implement a LRU cache
- implement an infinite/large sized Tic Tac Toe game? how to check for win conditions?
- optimize a memory situation, e.g. millions lines of data needs to be read into a server.
- string and array manipulations, minesweeper game, LRU Cache, Blackjack game, trees
- what is different between null and undefined ?


<br />
## Math

- cumulative sum of fibonacci series. fib(n) = addition of all the fibonacci numbers up to n-1
- find if an array of numbers that satisfy the fibonacci sequence.
- find the sum of the fibonacci numbers up to the n-th one
- how to figure out if an integer is out of range
- giving a 2D grid with pixels valued 0 or 1. How to check if pixels A and B are connected through a path of 0-valued pixels
- give a deck of card, calculate total number of point that is closes to 21. e.g. A,A,J = 12; J,J,A,2 = 23; A,2 = 13
- game of blackjack, implement a function for blackjack that returns the score of your hand - write code for `getScore()`:

  ```
  class Hand {
    List<Card> cards;
    int getScore( ) { }
  }
  ```
- reverse a number


<br />
## Linked List

- merge two sorted linked lists. Questions on time and space complexity.


<br />
## String

- find all anagrams of a given word. A array including all English words is provided.
- find first unique char in a string, find least greatest value with given target in a BST.
- find the length of string recursively.
- detects the first non-repeating character in a char array, and do so with only a single pass over the array
- given a dollar amount, output a textual representation (i.e. $123.43 -> "One hundred twenty three dollars and forty three cents”)
- parse a string into a double, where the string could be anything like "1 1/2" or "2/5" or "-3”.


<br />
## Tree

- implement a tree, e.g. insert and delete in a trinary tree
- adding and removing nodes from a ternary tree
- check if a binary tree a binary search tree.
- compare the node in an unsorted d-tree
- find the common ancestor of two nodes
- find the Least Common Ancestor given two nodes of a binary tree. The nodes each have a reference to their parent node and you do not have the root node of the tree.
- find LCA of a Binary Tree and making it efficient.
- given a binary tree and a sum, determine if the tree has a root-to-leaf path such that adding up all the values along the path equals the given sum. Follow-up: find all the paths
- lowest common ancestor in a BT
- questions about trees with unconventional structures
- validate if a tree is a BST
