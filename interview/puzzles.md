- Q: Find all logical reasons why man hole cover is round not a square.

- Q: Find only lighter bag from 8 (others weigh the same) by using a balance scale in 3 steps.

- Q: Four people need to cross a rickety bridge at night. Unfortunately, they have only one torch and the bridge is too dangerous to cross without one. The bridge is only strong enough to support two people at a time. Not all people take the same time to cross the bridge. Times for each person:  1 min, 2 mins, 7 mins and 10 mins. What is the shortest time needed for all four of them to cross the bridge?

- Q: How a father gives this 17 horses to 3 sons by 1/2, 1/3, and 1/9 ?

- Q: How many games must be played to find a winner if there are N players participating in a tournament ?

- Q: How many squares are on a chess board? If you thought the answer is 64, think again! How about all the squares that are formed by combining smaller squares on the chess board (2×2, 3×3, 4×4 squares and so on)?

  ```
  A = 1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + ... + n^2
  or
  A = (2 * n^3 + 3 * n^2 + 1) / 6
  ```

- Q: How to measure exactly 4 gallon of water from 3 gallon and 5 gallon jars, given, you have unlimited water supply from a running tap.

- Q: In a country where everyone wants a boy, each family continues having babies till they have a boy. After some time, what is the proportion of boys to girls in the country? (Assuming probability of having a boy or a girl is the same)

- Q: On Bagshot Island, there is an airport. The airport is the home base of an unlimited number of identical airplanes. Each airplane has a fuel capacity to allow it to fly exactly 1/2 way around the world, along a great circle. The planes have the ability to refuel in flight without loss of speed or spillage of fuel. Though the fuel is unlimited, the island is the only source of fuel. What is the fewest number of aircraft necessary to get one plane all the way around the world assuming that all of the aircraft must return safely to the airport? How did you get to your answer?

- Q: One train leaves City X for City Y at 15 mph. At the very same time, a train leaves City Y for City X at 20 mph on the same track. At the same moment, a bird leaves the City X train station and flies towards the City Y train station at 25 mph. When the bird reaches the train from City Y, it immediately reverses direction. It then continues to fly at the same speed towards the train from City X, when it reverses its direction again, and so forth. The bird continues to do this until the trains collide. How far would the bird have traveled in the meantime?

- Q: The probability of a car passing a certain intersection in a 20 minute windows is 0.9. What is the probability of a car passing the intersection in a 5 minute window? (Assuming a constant probability throughout)

- Q: Three ants are sitting at the three corners of an equilateral triangle. Each ant starts randomly picks a direction and starts to move along the edge of the triangle. What is the probability that none of the ants collide?

  ```
  P(No collision) =
  P(All ants go in a clockwise direction) +
  P(All ants go in an anti-clockwise direction)
  = 0.5 * 0.5 * 0.5 + 0.5 * 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25
  ```

- Q: Use only two ropes to measure 45 minutes: each rope has varying thickness and each burns in 60 minutes. (Those two ropes are not identical, they aren’t the same density nor the same length nor the same width).

- Q: You are blindfolded and 10 coins are place in front of you on table. You are allowed to touch the coins, but can’t tell which way up they are by feel. You are told that there are 5 coins head up, and 5 coins tails up but not which ones are which. How do you make two piles of coins each with the same number of heads up? You can flip the coins any number of times.

- Q: You are standing before two doors. One of the path leads to heaven and the other one leads to hell. There are two guardians, one by each door. You know one of them always tells the truth and the other always lies, but you don’t know who is the honest one and who is the liar. You can only ask one question to one of them in order to find the way to heaven. What is the question?

- Q: You have 10 boxes of balls (each ball weighing exactly10 gm) with one box with defective balls (each one of the defective balls weigh 9 gm). You are given an electronic weighing machine and only one chance at it. How will find out which box has the defective balls?

- Q: You have 100 doors in a row that are all initially closed. you make 100 passes by the doors starting with the first door every time. the first time through you visit every door and toggle the door (if the door is closed, you open it, if its open, you close it). the second time you only visit every 2nd door (door #2, #4, #6). the third time, every 3rd door (door #3, #6, #9), ec, until you only visit the 100th door. What state are the doors in after the last pass? Which are open which are closed?

- Q: You have 5 unbreakable light bulbs and a 80 floor building. Using fewest possible drops, determine how much of an impact this type of light bulb can withstand? Can it withstand a drop from 20th floor, but breaks from the 22th?

- Q: You have got someone working for you for seven days and a gold bar to pay them. You must pay the worker for their work at the end of every day. If you are only allowed to make two breaks in the gold bar, how do you pay your worker? (Assuming equal amount of work is done during each day thus requiring equal amount of pay for each day)

- Q: You have two identical eggs. Standing in front of a 100 floor building, you wonder what is the maximum number of floors from which the egg can be dropped without breaking it. What is the minimum number of tries needed to find out the solution?
