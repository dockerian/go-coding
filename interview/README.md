- design question for some hypothetical Task object. write the algorithm and design all the classes required to complete all the tasks, subtasks, and their dependent tasks.
- describe a particularly difficult concurrency problem you have faced and you solved it?
- difference between cloud (computing) and virtualization. (virtualization is a virtualized simulation of a device or resource, e.g. storage, network, memory; cloud is shared computing resources, software, or data are delivered as a service and on-demand through the Internet.)
- explain server caching/sessions
- given a log of pages clicked on website by users (sorted by timestamp), find the top ten most clicked 3 page sequence. A 3 page sequence, is a sequence of 3 pages clicked by the same user in successive order.

<a name="design-and-scrum"><br /></a>
## Design and Scrum

- design:
  - a card game, with Card, Hand, Deck, and interfaces
  - a chess game, or a borad game
  - a database model for movie ticketing system
  - a parking lot, e.g. with FindBestSpot()
  - a scalable twitter feed filter system which builds a public sentiment every minute.
  - an elevator system
- design patterns
  - creational patterns
    - abstract factory
    - builder
    - factory method
    - prototype
  - behaviorial patterns
    - command
    - strategy
    - state
  - structural patterns
    - adapter
    - bridge
    - decorator
    - facade
  - concurrency patterns
- explain SOLID, KISS, and DRY (principles of software development)
  * DRY=Don't Repeat Yourself;
  * KISS=Keep It Simple, S*****;
  * SOLID
    - **Single responsibility**: only one potential change to affect the spec;
    - **Open-closed**: a well-encapsulated and highly-cohesive system open for extension but closed for modification;
    - **Liskov substitution**: every subclass/derived class should be substitutable for their base/parent class
    - **Interface segregation**: many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface;
    - **Dependency inversion**: entities must depend on abstractions not on concretions;
    - see http://www.codemag.com/article/1001061
- dependency inversion (IoC)
  - a special form of decoupling
  - high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
  - abstractions should not depend upon details. Details should depend upon abstractions.
  - implementations:
    - factory pattern
    - service locator pattern
    - dependency injection:
      - interface (type 1)
      - constructor (type 3)
      - setter (type 3)
- compare mvp vs mvc vs mvvm
  - MVP: view <=> presenter <=> model (inputs begin with view)
  - MVC: views <= controller => model \[=> view] (starts with controller)
  - MVVM: view <= viewmodel <=> model (inputs begin with view)

- compare mutex vs semaphore

- describe properties of RESTful
  - Representational State Transfer (REST) is an architectural style
  - **Uniform interface**: a fixed set of CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations: POST, GET, PUT, and DELETE
  - **Resource identification**: data and functionality are considered resources and accessible through URI
  - **Self-descriptive messages**: Resources are decoupled from representation so that the content can be accessed in a variety of formats, e.g. HTML/text, XML, JSON, JPEG, PDF
  - **Stateless to stateful interactions**: use stateless communication protocol, e.g. HTTP, (with stateless resource and self-contained request messages) to transfer states (e.g. embedded in response message)

- explain Responsive Web Design (RWD). how it comares to adaptive design ?
  - a design approach which prioritizes on giving the user
    an optimal viewing/reading and navigational experience
    across multiple devices and screen resolutions
    by utilizing many design concepts.
  - the goal is to have one content base with multiple 'disconnected' views.
    The word responsive signifies that your content responds to
    the user's current view (i.e. resolution, capabilities etc.) and
    the design process is all about optimizing and creating views.
  - Bootstrap is the most popular CSS, HTML and JS framework
    used for developing responsive web design
  - see http://www.alistapart.com/articles/responsive-web-design/
  - adaptive web design essentially utilizes many of the components of
    progressive enhancement (PE) as a way to define the set of
    design methods that focus on the user and not the browser.
    Using a predefined set of layout sizes based on device screen size
    along with CSS and JavaScript, the AWD approach adapts to the detected device.
    The three layers of Progressive Enhancement:
      - Content layer = rich semantic HTML markup
      - Presentation layer = CSS and styling
      - Client-side scripting layer = JavaScript or jQuery behaviors

- discuss [NP-complete problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_NP-complete_problems)

- compare type conversion vs type assertion
- compare `v.(type)` vs `v.(string)` (`v.(SomeTypeName)`), where `v` is `interface{}`
- use [reflection](https://blog.golang.org/laws-of-reflection)

- explain about the various modules you used in the Node.js app
- explain box model (html/css)
- explain closure
- how prototype works, comparing to e.g. inheritance in C++/C#/Java
- javascript method overloading - see [here](http://ejohn.org/blog/javascript-method-overloading/)
- LESS/Bootstrap


<a name="database"><br /></a>
## Database

- collation is defined to specify the sort order in a table. 3 types (case in/sensitive, binary)
- common table expression (CTE), as a temp query/view

  ```sql
  WITH foo_cte AS (
    SELECT a, b FROM [foo_table]
  ) --, bar_cte AS (
    --  SELECT c, d FROM [bar_table]
  ),
  SELECT * FROM [foo_cte] -- JOIN [bar_cte] ON ...
  ```

- find duplicate rows

  ```sql
  SELECT col_name, COUNT(*) count FROM table GROUP BY col_name HAVING count > 1
  SELECT DISTINCT col_name, count(col_name) FROM table GROUP BY col_name
  ```

- delete duplicate rows

  ```sql
  WITH cte_rows AS (
      SELECT ROW_NUMBER()
      OVER (PARTITION BY Col1, Col2 ORDER BY (SELECT 0)) RN
      FROM #MyTable)
  DELETE FROM cte_rows
  WHERE  RN > 1;
  ```
  or on MySQL (without `CTE` or `PARTITION BY` clause)

  ```sql
  -- to keep highest id
  DELETE t1 FROM table t1, table t2
   WHERE t1.id < t2.id AND t1.col_name == t2.col_name
  ```
  or

  ```sql
  -- to keep lowest id
  DELETE t1 FROM table t1, table t2
   WHERE t1.id < t2.id AND t1.col_name == t2.col_name
  ```
  or

  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE tmp_table LIKE src_table;
  INSERT INTO tmp_table(id) SELECT MAX(id) as id
    FROM src_table
    GROUP BY field1, field2
    HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
  DELETE FROM src_table
    WHERE id IN (SELECT id FROM tmp_table)
  DROP TABLE tmp_table
  ```
  or on other system allows deleting from the same table

  ```sql
  DELETE FROM src_table src
    WHERE src.id IN (
      SELECT MAX(dup.id)
      FROM src_table as dup
      GROUP BY dup.field1, dup.field2
      HAVING COUNT(*) > 1 )
  ```

- difference between clustered and a non-clustered index? (clustered index reorder the row as physically stored, the leaf nodes contain the data pages)
- difference between primary key and unique key? (PR constraint is a unique identifier for each row, it creates clustered index and does not allow NULL)
- difference between `DELETE` and `TRUNCATE` commands?
- difference between `HAVING` clause and `WHERE` clause? (`HAVING` used only with the GROUP BY)
- explain ACID: 4 properties to qualify a transaction (which is a sequence of operations performed as a single logical unit of work)
  - Atomicity: as atomic unit of work, either all or none of modifications are perform.
  - Consistency: all data in a consistent state; all rules must be applied to maintain all data integrity.
  - Isolation: modifications must be isolated from modifications made by any other concurrent transaction.
  - Durability: modifications persist permanently in the system, even in the event of system failure.
  - Lock modes: Intent shared (IS), Intent exclusive (IX), Shared with intent exclusive (SIX), Intent update (IU), Shared intent update (SIU), Update intent exclusive (UIX)
  - see https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj856598(v=sql.110).aspx

  - depth-first (pre-order):
      - top-down order
      - e.g. reading hierarchical document in natural oder (chapters/sections/... in a book)
      - e.g. prefix expression tree `"(a+b)*c" => * + a b c` (Polish Notation) in arithmetic parser

  ```javascript
  //        A(root)
  //       /      \
  //      B        G
  //     /  \       \

  - depth-first (in-order)
    - e.g. binary search tree, or infix `(a+b)*c`

  ```javascript
  //        F(root)
  //       /      \
  //      B        G
  //     /  \       \

  //       C   E   H
  //

      depthFirstInOrder(node.left, nodeList);
      nodeList.push(node);
      depthFirstInOrder(node.right, nodeList);
    }
  }
  ```
  - depth-first (post-order)
    - bottom-up order, visiting all leaves before their parent
    - e.g. postfix expression tree `"(a+b)*c" => a b + c *` (Reverse Polish Notation) in arithmetic parser

  ```javascript
  //        I(root)
  //       /      \
  //      E        H
  //     /  \       \
  //    A    D       G
  //        / \     /
  //       B   C   F
  //
  depthFirstPostOrder(node, nodeList) {
    if (node) {
      depthFirstInOrder(node.left, nodeList);
      depthFirstInOrder(node.right, nodeList);
      nodeList.push(node);
    }

- tree construction
  - create from pre-order

  ```javascript
  fromPreOrder(inputs) {
     var root = {};
     var size = inputs.length;
     var half = size / 2 + 1;
     if (size > 0) {
       root.value = inputs[0]; // first item is the root
       if (size > 1) {

         root.left = fromPreOrder(inputs.slice(half, size));
       }
     }
     return null;
  }
  ```

  - create from post-order

  ```javascript
  fromPostOrder(inputs) {
     var root = {};
     var size = inputs.length;
     var half = size / 2;
     if (size > 0) {
       root.value = inputs[size-1]; // last item is the root
       if (size > 1) {
         root.left = fromPreOrder(inputs.slice(0, half));

         root.left = fromPreOrder(inputs.slice(half, size-1));
       }
     }
     return null;
  }
  ```

  - create from in-order

  ```javascript
  fromInOrder(inputs) {
     var root = {};
     var size = inputs.length;
     var half = size / 2;
     if (size > 0) {
