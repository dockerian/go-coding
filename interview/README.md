<br />
## General

- data team: DSA and data science questions; algorithms and data structures questions with attention to complexity and possible optimizations.
- describe a hash table in as much detail as possible
- describe different types of sorting methods, eval time complexity from best to worst.
- describe the principles of object-oriented programming
- design an API for an elevator.
- design a cache
- design and implement a hash map
- design question for some hypothetical Task object. write the algorithm and design all the classes required to complete all the tasks, subtasks, and their dependent tasks.
- describe a particularly difficult concurrency problem you have faced and you solved it?
- difference between cloud (computing) and virtualization. (virtualization is a virtualized simulation of a device or resource, e.g. storage, network, memory; cloud is shared computing resources, software, or data are delivered as a service and on-demand through the Internet.)
- explain about the various modules you used in the Node.js app
- general big-O questions, hashmap vs binary tree, heap data structure.
- given a log of pages clicked on website by users (sorted by timestamp), find the top ten most clicked 3 page sequence. A 3 page sequence, is a sequence of 3 pages clicked by the same user in successive order.
- how does garbage collection work in .NET?
- implement a LRU cache
- implement an infinite/large sized Tic Tac Toe game? how to check for win conditions?
- optimize a memory situation, e.g. millions lines of data needs to be read into a server.
- parse json and store the result in a csv file
- string and array manipulations, minesweeper game, LRU Cache, Blackjack game, trees
- what are the four pillars of Object Oriented Programming?
- what is different between null and undefined ?
- write an elevator controller


<br />
## Database

- use nested SQL select statements to determine a value in table A from information in table B


<br />
## Network

- describe the OSI layers and give an example of each
- troubleshoot a network connection from your workstation to a server inside the company? and from your workstation to a client in another time zone?


<br />
## Math

- cumulative sum of fibonacci series. fib(n) = addition of all the fibonacci numbers up to n-1
- design a recursive method that calculates a fibonacci sequence, rewrite it to remove the recursion and reduce its time complexity.
- find if an array of numbers that satisfy the fibonacci sequence.
- find prime numbers within 0..N
- find the sum of the fibonacci numbers up to the n-th one
- how to figure out if an integer is out of range
- giving a 2D grid with pixels valued 0 or 1. How to check if pixels A and B are connected through a path of 0-valued pixels
- give a deck of card, calculate total number of point that is closes to 21. e.g. A,A,J = 12; J,J,A,2 = 23; A,2 = 13
- game of blackjack, implement a function for blackjack that returns the score of your hand - write code for `getScore()`:

  ```
  class Hand {
    List<Card> cards;
    int getScore( ) { }
  }
  ```
- print out Fibonacci series in MATLAB
- reverse a number


<br />
## Linked List

- find a loop in a linked list
- find the middle of a linked list with only one pass and 2 pointers (references)
- merge two sorted linked lists. Questions on time and space complexity.
- reverse a linked list


<br />
## Map

-


<br />
## String

- find all anagrams of a given word. A array including all English words is provided.
- find first unique char in a string, find least greatest value with given target in a BST.
- find the length of string recursively.
- detects the first non-repeating character in a char array, and do so with only a single pass over the array
- given a dollar amount, output a textual representation (i.e. $123.43 -> "One hundred twenty three dollars and forty three cents”)
- inverts the case of each character in a string
- parse a string into a double, where the string could be anything like "1 1/2" or "2/5" or "-3”.


<br />
## Tree

- implement a tree, e.g. insert and delete in a trinary tree
- adding and removing nodes from a ternary tree
- check if a binary tree a binary search tree.
- compare the node in an unsorted d-tree
- find the common ancestor of two nodes
- find the Least Common Ancestor given two nodes of a binary tree. The nodes each have a reference to their parent node and you do not have the root node of the tree.
- find LCA of a Binary Tree and making it efficient.
- given a binary tree and a sum, determine if the tree has a root-to-leaf path such that adding up all the values along the path equals the given sum. Follow-up: find all the paths
- lowest common ancestor in a BT
- questions about trees with unconventional structures
- search through a binary search tree, what is the worst-case big-O complexity?
- validate if a tree is a BST
