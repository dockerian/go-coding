<a name="general"><br /></a>
## General

- data team: DSA and data science questions; algorithms and data structures questions with attention to complexity and possible optimizations.
- describe the principles of object-oriented programming
- design an API for an elevator.
- design a cache
- design question for some hypothetical Task object. write the algorithm and design all the classes required to complete all the tasks, subtasks, and their dependent tasks.
- describe a particularly difficult concurrency problem you have faced and you solved it?
- difference between cloud (computing) and virtualization. (virtualization is a virtualized simulation of a device or resource, e.g. storage, network, memory; cloud is shared computing resources, software, or data are delivered as a service and on-demand through the Internet.)
- explain server caching/sessions
- given a log of pages clicked on website by users (sorted by timestamp), find the top ten most clicked 3 page sequence. A 3 page sequence, is a sequence of 3 pages clicked by the same user in successive order.
- how does garbage collection work in .NET?
- implement a LRU cache
- implement an infinite/large sized Tic Tac Toe game? how to check for win conditions?
- optimize a memory situation, e.g. millions lines of data needs to be read into a server.
- parse json and store the result in a csv file
- string and array manipulations, minesweeper game, LRU Cache, Blackjack game, trees
- what are the four pillars of Object Oriented Programming?
- what is different between null and undefined ?
- what is JSON ? how to read and write ? (key-value pair; use stream/text reader/writer to deserialize/serialize)
- write an elevator controller


<a name="data-structure"><br /></a>
## Data Structure

- big-O questions, hash map vs binary tree, heap data structure.
- compare min-heap, max-heap, and priority queue
- describe a hash table in as much detail as possible
- describe different types of sorting methods, eval time complexity from best to worst.
- design and implement a hash map


<a name="design-and-scrum"><br /></a>
## Design and Scrum

- design:
	- a card game, with Card, Hand, Deck, and interfaces
	- a parking lot, e.g. with FindBestSpot()
	- an elevator system
- design patterns
	- creational patterns
		- abstract factory
		- builder
		- factory method
		- prototype
	- behaviorial patterns
		- command
		- strategy
		- state
	- structural patterns
		- adapter
		- bridge
		- decorator
		- facade
	- concurrency patterns
- explain SOLID, KISS, and DRY (principles of software development)
	* DRY=Don't Repeat Yourself;
	* KISS=Keep It Simple, S*****;
	* SOLID
		- **Single responsibility**: only one potential change to affect the spec;
		- **Open-closed**: a well-encapsulated and highly-cohesive system open for extension but closed for modification;
		- **Liskov substitution**: every subclass/derived class should be substitutable for their base/parent class
		- **Interface segregation**: many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface;
		- **Dependency inversion**: entities must depend on abstractions not on concretions;
		- see http://www.codemag.com/article/1001061
- dependency inversion (IoC)
	- a special form of decoupling
	- high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
	- abstractions should not depend upon details. Details should depend upon abstractions.
	- implementations:
		- factory pattern
		- service locator pattern
		- dependency injection:
			- interface (type 1)
			- constructor (type 3)
			- setter (type 3)
- mvp vs mvc vs mvvm
	- MVP: view <=> presenter <=> model (inputs begin with view)
	- MVC: views <= controller => model \[=> view] (starts with controller)
	- MVVM: view => viewmodel <=> model (inputs begin with view)

<a name="database"><br /></a>
## Database

- collation is defined to specify the sort order in a table. 3 types (case in/sensitive, binary)
- common table expression (CTE), as a temp query/view

	```
	WITH foo_cte AS (
		SELECT a, b FROM [foo_table]
	) --, bar_cte AS (
	  --	SELECT c, d FROM [bar_table]
	),
	SELECT * FROM [foo_cte] -- JOIN [bar_cte] ON ...
	```

- delete duplicate rows

	```
	WITH cte_rows AS (
	    SELECT ROW_NUMBER()
	    OVER (PARTITION BY Col1, Col2 ORDER BY (SELECT 0)) RN
	    FROM #MyTable)
	DELETE FROM cte_rows
	WHERE  RN > 1;
	```

- difference between clustered and a non-clustered index? (clustered index reorder the row as physically stored, the leaf nodes contain the data pages)
- difference between primary key and unique key? (PR constraint is a unique identifier for each row, it creates clustered index and does not allow NULL)
- difference between `DELETE` and `TRUNCATE` commands?
- difference between `HAVING` clause and `WHERE` clause? (`HAVING` used only with the GROUP BY)
- explain ACID: 4 properties to qualify a transaction (which is a sequence of operations performed as a single logical unit of work)
	- Atomicity: as atomic unit of work, either all or none of modifications are perform.
	- Consistency: all data in a consistent state; all rules must be applied to maintain all data integrity.
	- Isolation: modifications must be isolated from modifications made by any other concurrent transaction.
	- Durability: modifications persist permanently in the system, even in the event of system failure.
	- Lock modes: Intent shared (IS), Intent exclusive (IX), Shared with intent exclusive (SIX), Intent update (IU), Shared intent update (SIU), Update intent exclusive (UIX)
	- see https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj856598(v=sql.110).aspx

	| Read committed   | No         | Yes                | Yes     |
	| Repeatable read  | No         | No                 | Yes     |
