## Agile Methodology

### General

  * sdlc process: agile vs waterfall
    - requirements collection (including doc/draft/mock, and a.c.)
    - design / architecture
    - documentation/testing against requirements (iteration)
    - prototype / coding
    - unit testing (iteration back to coding)
    - behavioral, functional / integration test
    - documentation (optional)
    - deploy / release

  * selecting methodology based on
    - Budget
    - Team size
    - Project criticality
    - Technology used
    - Documentation
    - Training
    - Best practices/lessons learned
    - Tools and techniques
    - Existing processes
    - Software

  * lightweight (vs heavyweight)
    - accommodate change well.
    - people oriented rather than process oriented; tend to work with people rather than against them.
    - complemented by the use of dynamic checklists.
    - project teams are smaller.
    - rely on working in a team environment.
    - foster knowledge sharing.
    - feedback is almost instantaneous.
    - project manager doesnâ€™t need to develop "heavy" project documentation but instead is able to focus on the absolute necessary documentation (e.g., the project schedule).
    - learning methodologies. After each build or iteration, the team learns to correct issues on the project, forming an improvement cycle throughout the project.

  * each story
    - acceptance criteria
    - design/documentation/review/test
    - check gates to close

  * code quality
    - readable
    - unit-testable
    - design pattern (interface and composition)
    - DRY, SOLID (single responsibility, open-closed, Listkov/subtyping, interface segregation, dependency inversion) principles
    - linter/pep8/styling police

### Reference: Manifesto for Agile Software Development

  * More value on the left items
    - Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
    - Working software over comprehensive documentation
    - Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
    - Responding to change over following a plan

  * Twelve principles:
    - Highest priority is to satisfy the customer thru early & continuous delivery of valuable software.
    - Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.
    - Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
    - Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
    - Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
    - The most efficient and effective method of  conveying information to and within a development  team is face-to-face conversation.
    - Working software is the primary measure of progress.
    - Agile processes promote sustainable development.  The sponsors, developers, and users should be able  to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
    - Continuous attention to technical excellence  and good design enhances agility.
    - Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount  of work not done--is essential.
    - The best architectures, requirements, and designs  emerge from self-organizing teams.
    - At regular intervals, the team reflects on how  to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts  its behavior accordingly.


## Software Development Principles

### S.O.L.I.D

  * Single responsibility principle
    i.e. changes to only one part of the software's specification should be able to affect the specification of the class.
    <br/>
  * Open/closed principle
    software entities should be **open for extension, but closed for modification**.
    <br/>
  * Liskov substitution principle
    derived types must be completely substitutable for their base types - objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program.
    <br/>
  * Interface segregation principle
    many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.
    <br/>
  * Dependency inversion principle
    depend upon abstractions, not concretions.
    <br/>

### Java/C#/C++ (additional/alternative to SOLID)
  * Encapsulate what varies
  * Programming for Interface not implementation
  * Favor Composition over Inheritance
  * Strives for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact (Loosely coupled high cohesion)

### Python

  * DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
  * KISS (Keep it simple, St\*pid)


### Design Patterns

  * **Abstract Factory**, Factory Method, Builder, Prototype, **Singleton** (- creational patterns)
  * **Adapter**, Bridge, **Composite**, **Decorator**, Facade, Flyweight, Proxy (- structural patterns)
  * Chain of Responsibility, **Command**, Intrepreter, Iterator, Mediator, Memento, **Observer**, **State**, **Strategy**, Template Method, Visitor (- behavioural patterns)
